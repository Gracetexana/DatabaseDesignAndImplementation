# Database Design and Implementation

## Taught by Professor Sylvia Perez-Hardy at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during the first half of my second semester at RIT from August 2023 to October 2023. We worked enirely with SQL. Because my goal is simply to show my SQL abilities, NOT to provide answers to the homework and tests in this class, I will not provide the specific instructions to any of these assignments, as it would consequently be far too likely that they would show up in search results.
